# Projects

This repo is intended as a collection of data analysis/science projects written in Python (jupyter notebook), to apply the tools I learned (and I am currently learning) to interesting scenarios with a policy relevance, and to simply have fun exploring data.
1. The first project I have been working on concerns a topic I am particularly interested in: mental health and depression.
