# Projects

This repo is intended as a collection of data analysis/science projects written in Python (Jupyter notebook), to apply the tools I learned (and I am currently learning) to interesting scenarios with a *policy* relevance, and to simply have fun exploring data.
1. My castone project involved scraping 1000 reviews from a **public API of the Movie Database**, performing data normalisation through tokenisation, stop-word removal and lemmatisation, assigning binary scores to positive/negative reviews, applying a Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency Vectorisation to extract features out of the reviews and then fitting a Logistic Regression that is later evaluated.
2. The project investigates an area of particular interest to me: **youth depression**. Following extensive data cleaning on a large individual-level dataset downloaded from Kaggle, I applied multiple machine learning algorithms to examine which features are most effective in predicting the likelihood of an individual experiencing depression.
3. *[work in progress]* My third project is a dashboard displaying several tables and graphs on development data across the years.
