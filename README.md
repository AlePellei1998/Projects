# Projects

This repo is intended as a collection of data analysis/science projects written in Python (jupyter notebook), to apply the tools I learned (and I am currently learning) to interesting scenarios with a policy relevance, and to simply have fun exploring data.
1. The project investigates an area of particular relevance to me: **youth depression**. Following extensive data cleaning on a large individual-level dataset, I applied multiple machine learning algorithms to examine which features are most effective in predicting the likelihood of an individual experiencing depression.
