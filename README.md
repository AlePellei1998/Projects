# Projects

This repo is intended as a collection of data analysis/science projects written in Python (jupyter notebook), motivated by two clear objectives. Objective 1: apply to interesting scenarios with policy relevance the tools I learned in my Data Science course (and that I am currently learning). Objective 2: have fun.
