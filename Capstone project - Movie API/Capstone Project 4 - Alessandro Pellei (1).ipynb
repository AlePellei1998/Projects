    "# How accurately can two classification models predict the VADER sentiment of movie reviews?"

    "<b>Objective of the project</b>:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to evaluate the accuracy of two classification models, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, in predicting the VADER sentiment—positive or negative—of movie reviews. The objectives are twofold: first, to compare and contrast the performance of these models, identifying similarities and differences in their scoring; second, to solidify the knowledge gained in class through a comprehensive and practical application of sentiment analysis techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Data</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "I have scraped the public API of The Movie Data Base (https://www.themoviedb.org/), from which I have pulled out over 2700 reviews from 1030 different movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Steps</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps I have taken to arrive at my final results are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Step 1_. I have scraped 1000 reviews from a public API of the Movie Data Base;\n",
    "\n",
    "_Step 2_. I have performed data normalization to the reviews, through tokenization, stop word removal and lemmatization. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Step 3_. I have computed the VADER sentiment scores for each review and assigned a value of 1 to the positive reviews and 0 to the negative reviews, based on the compound. I assume that these scores are just \"given\" for each single review. These are the scores I will predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Step 4_. I have applied the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency Vectorization to extract features out of the reviews, based on the frequency each word appears and their relative importance across the corpus of reviews. This produces a sparse matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Step 5_. I have fitted a Logistic Regression and a Naive Bayes model using the binary sentiment as response y and the sparse matrix as features X to the models. Given the class imbalance that I get from the data, whereby the majority of reviews are marked as \"positive\", I undersample the majority class and run the two models again.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Step 6_. I have evaluated, and compared, the soundness of each model against each other, before and after the undersampling of the majority class and with respect to the the baseline model by looking at different metrics (accuracy, precision, recall and false positive rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Results</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first fit the two models, I get an accuracy that is comparable to that of the baseline model, but I obtain a very low recall for the minority class, whereby only a small portion of the negative reviews were correctly identified by the two models. Also, given the strong class imbalance in favour of positive reviews, the baseline model has an accuracy similar to the one either models leads to. This is not good enough. However, when undersampling the majority class to make sure that there are as many negative reviews as there are positive, which is a rather far-fetched assumption, both models improve drastically in overall accuracy, precision and recall and perform better than the baseline model's accuracy (now 50%).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Limitations</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several limitations to this project:\n",
    "- <b>Strong Assumption about VADER sentiment</b>. The model assumes that the VADER sentiment scores accurately represent the true sentiment of the reviewer. However, this might not always be the case, as VADER is known to exhibit a bias toward positive scoring and may not fully capture nuances such as sarcasm, context, or mixed sentiments often present in movie reviews. To address this limitation, future work could incorporate additional features, such as the star ratings provided by reviewers, which could be translated into numerical values to offer a more grounded and diverse perspective on sentiment classification.\n",
    "- <b>Class Imbalance Handling Through Undersampling</b>. The decision to address class imbalance by undersampling the majority class introduces an artificial balance in the data that may not reflect the real-world distribution of sentiments in movie reviews.\n",
    "- <b>Limited Dataset Size and Diversity</b>. While 2700 reviews from 1030 movies provide a starting point, the dataset is relatively small for text classification tasks, especially given the complexity of natural language. This limitation may hinder the model's ability to generalize effectively across different types of reviews, genres, or linguistic styles, reducing its robustness in broader applications\n"
